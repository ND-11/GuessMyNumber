Welcome,

Simply this is a simple practice, the user has to guess the random number (chosen by a random number generator) the number is between 1 and 20, and the goal is to get the highest score which is 20 by guessing the number at the first try, once guessing wrong the score gets decreases by one, once the score is zero you lose.

Feel free to send me any info, or code improvements that can help me in my programming journey!!
